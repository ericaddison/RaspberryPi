####1. Keyboard Region
  edit file `/etc/default/keyboard` and change to `XKBLAYOUT="us"`
  
####2. Wireless Setup
  edit file `/etc/network/interfaces` and insert
```
  auto wlan0
  iface wlan0 inet dhcp 
    wpa-ssid {ssid}
    wpa-psk  {password}
```

  Some command line wireless tools are:
  
  * First, get your WiFi card up and running:
  
  `sudo ifconfig wlan0 up`
  
  * Now scan for a list of WiFi networks in range. You might be typing your name wr$
  
  `sudo iwlist wlan0 scan`
  
  * This will show you a list of wireless networks, pick yours from the list:
  
  `sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid Wifi2Home key s:ABCDE12345`
  
  * To obtain the IP address, now request it with the Dynamic Host Client:
  
  `sudo dhclient wlan0`
  
  * (possible solution here for dropping wifi: https://github.com/dirttech/SmartMeter/blob/master/wifi_drop.sh)


####3. prevent SSH from dropping idle connections
  If you leave PuTTY connected for long periods of time (especially on tail -f /some/log/file) you may have noticed the SSH server disconnects you after a while if there is no new input on that log file.

  You could configure PuTTY to enable connection keepalive functionality, but youâ€™d need to either do that for every session or every saved server in the list.

  The easier way is to enable this functionality on the servers themselves, by editing the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and adding/editing this line:

`clientaliveinterval 60`

  This will make the server send a keepalive packet every 60 seconds, preventing the disconnection of idle sessions.
  
####4. Software install and config
  1. vim

	`sudo apt-get install vim`
	`echo "syntax on" >> ~/.vimrc`

####5. Dowload and build Julia
  `sudo apt-get install libblas3gf liblapack3gf libfftw3-dev libgmp3-dev libmpfr-dev libblas-dev liblapack-dev gfortran cmake    gcc-4.7  g++-4.7 libgfortran3`
  `git clone https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia.git`
  
  `cd julia`
  
  `make`
  
  Trying `make USE_SYSTEM_LIBM=1`
  
  Running this since last line didn't work: `sudo apt-get install libblas3gf liblapack3gf libfftw3-dev libgmp3-dev libmpfr-dev libblas-dev liblapack-dev cmake gcc-4.8 g++-4.8 gfortran libgfortran3 m4 libedit-dev`
  
  Meh, giving up for now... Check for ARM binaries some time in the future...
  
  
####6. Add user and groups
  `sudo adduser eric`
  
  `sudo adduser eric sudo`
  
  `sudo adduser eric gpio`
  
  `sudo adduser eric kmem`

  `sudo chmod 660 /dev/mem`
